Brändi Dog is generally played by four people. Two people are in a team and play together. You must get your own marbles out of the home base (Kennel) and to the finish.

During the game you are supported by your partner and sent home by your opponents. The marbles are moved by playing the cards. It is not possible to win as an individual player. When one player has all their own marbles at the finish, they then help their partner to get their marbles to the finish. The team has only won once the team’s eight marbles have all reached the finish.

1. Board
   Game Rules
   Two people sit diagonally opposite each other, they play together and are a team. Each player has their four marbles in the kennel.

2. Cards and Actions
   Two packs of Bridge-cards, which each contain 55 cards, are mixed together.
   Game Rules
   Cards Actions
   ACE Start or 1 or 11 spots forwards
   TWO 2 spots forwards
   THREE 3 spots forwards
   FOUR 4 spots forwards or backwards
   FIVE, SIX Number of points forwards
   SEVEN Can be divided up onto the individual marbles in any forwards moves (e.g. 5 + 2). All 7 points have to be moved though. All marbles that are overtaken by the 7 have to go back to the kennel.
   EIGHT, NINE, TEN Number of points forwards
   JAKE A marble must be exchanged with a marble belonging to the opponent or partner.
   QUEEN 12 spots forward
   KING Start or 13 spots forwards
   JOKER Use as any other card you want (break this into two steps: first action specifies card to swap, second action how to play the new card).
   2.1 Start
   You move one marble from the kennel to the start with an ACE, a KING or a JOKER. Marbles which are played from the kennel to the start, block access and passage for all marbles (even your own). This marble is also protected and cannot be sent home.

Game Rules
2.2 Finish
In order to end up at the finish, a player’s start must have been passed at least twice, whether going backwards or forwards. The finish is filled from the inside to the outside. The card SEVEN is particularly useful for reaching the finish because the SEVEN can be divided up into any individual values.

Game Rules
2.3 Exchange Marbles
With a JACK, a marble must be exchanged with a marble belonging to the opponent or partner, even if this is a disadvantage. Marbles that land on a player’s start for the first time, that are at the finish, or are still in the kennel, cannot be exchanged. If only your own marbles are in play and you cannot make any other moves, then the JACK can be played at the end without effect.

Game Rules
2.4 Overtaking
If a marble, including one that belongs to the same player, is overtaken by a whole or split up SEVEN, then it is sent back to the kennel. Marbles which are played out of the kennel at the start cannot be overtaken (blockade). Otherwise, overtaking is allowed.

Game Rules
2.5 Sending Home
If two marbles, including two that belong to the same player, land on the same field, the one that was there first is sent back to the kennel. If a marble lands on the starting field again on the way to the finish, it no longer blocks the entrance and can be swapped or sent home. Marbles that are already at the finish cannot be sent back to the kennel.

Game Rules 3. Rounds
The game is played in rounds, where each player gets a set of cards. The «game server» takes on the role of the "dealer", that usually hands out the cards.

Each round, the number of cards change:

1st Round: 6 cards
2nd Round: 5 cards
3rd Round: 4 cards
4th Round: 3 cards
5th Round: 2 cardss
(repeat)
It then starts over with 6 cards, 5, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5, 4 etc. again.

3.1 Game Start
Usually the person who is sitting to the right of the «dealer» starts the game, but here we let the «game server» chose a random person to start the game.

3.2 Card Exchange
At the beginning of a round, each of the partners exchange one card without revealing it. The cards that have been exchanged are supposed to facilitate clever game moves. If your partner still has all of their marbles in the kennel for example, you help them move to the start with a KING; ACE or JOKER.

3.4 Turns
In each round, players take turns to lay down one card on the centre of the board and move the marble according to the value of the card.

The next player to the right (anti-clock wise) then takes their move etc. until the round has finished, which is when all of the players have put down and revealed all of their cards. If a player can’t make a move any more because a move isn’t possible with their corresponding card values, then that player doesn’t take part in that round. Their cards are omitted and are placed in the middle.

After each round, the start of the game moves from one person to the next in an anti-clockwise direction.

3.4 Finish
The winner is the team that has all their marbles safely placed at the finish line. When the first player on the team has placed his pieces on the target, he must move his teammate's pieces with the remaining cards.
